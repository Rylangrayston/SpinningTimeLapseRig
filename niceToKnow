// there has been alot of discussion as to where or not you can use the L6470 driver
// for milling machines and many other purposes where 2 or more motors
// need to be synchronized as well as have dynamically assigned  speeds.
// the problem is there is no clear/actual way to change the speed register wile the motor
//is running, some have suggested to just use the L6470 in step at a time mode
// but I feel this is a waste of allot of great features ie stall detection.
// So without further adue here is the code ( sorry this is code from an arduion
but it shuld get the point across)

void loop()
{
  // 200 steps is one revolution on a 1.8 deg/step motor.
  dSPIN_Move(FWD, 40);
  while (digitalRead(dSPIN_BUSYN) == LOW);  // wait Until the movement completes, the
  dSPIN_SetParam(dSPIN_MAX_SPEED, MaxSpdCalc(max_speed_rise));
  max_speed_rise += acceleration_rate;
  if (max_speed_rise > 100){
    acceleration_rate = -1;
   
  }
  if (max_speed_rise < 1){
    acceleration_rate = 1;
    delay (1000);
  }

}


if you run this you will see that the stepper s acceleration
//is nice and smooth while still being controlled dynamicaly ( wile the motor is
// running ) It is a very simple work around ...
In truth the motors speed is changing inbetween move commands,
but this is happening so often that it is very smooth!

// now the comes the part thats not done yet ... daisy chaining,
// using the method dynamic speed method combined with daisy chaining
// one more thing ... load all the bits but one on the daisy chain while the
// motor is finishing the previous command then using an interrupt as soon as
// the L6470 busy pins are all low load the last bit in the daisy ..
// this should reduce any delays that could cause motor noise!

again this code is from an arduino but I hope it is helpful here ..
shoot me a message if you improve on it !
